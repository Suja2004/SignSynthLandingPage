# SignSynth

Bridging the gap between spoken language and Sign Language through AI.

SignSynth is an innovative accessibility platform designed to empower the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. By leveraging synthetic media and artificial intelligence, SignSynth provides a seamless interface for translating spoken and written language into accurate, fluid Sign Language animations in real-time.

Our mission is to foster inclusivity by making digital content and daily communication accessible to everyone, regardless of their hearing ability.

## Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Translation Engine

- Voice Recognition Integration: Captures spoken audio and translates it into visual sign language on the fly.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzes sentence structure to ensure context-aware translations rather than direct word-for-word mapping.

### Visual Rendering

- High-Fidelity Avatars: Utilizes 3D character models to perform complex hand gestures essential for Sign Language.

- Real-time Rendering: Optimized performance to ensure smooth gesture playback with minimal latency.

### Accessibility & Education

- Learning Tool: Serves as an interactive educational aid for those learning Sign Language.

- Speed Control & Looping: Allows users to adjust the playback speed of the avatar and loop specific gestures, making it easier to study and practice complex signs.
